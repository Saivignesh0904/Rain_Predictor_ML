# Rain_Predictor_ML

This project aims to predict whether it will rain **tomorrow** based on historical weather data.  
Using machine learning classification techniques, the notebook walks through:

- Data preprocessing  
- Exploratory data analysis  
- Feature engineering  
- Model selection and training  
- Performance evaluation  

This project is useful for learning data science workflows or building predictive environmental models 

Dataset Source: ("https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/_0eYOqji3unP1tDNKWZMjg/weatherAUS-2.csv")  
- Contains weather features such as:
  - Temperature  
  - Humidity  
  - Wind Speed  
  - Atmospheric Pressure  
  - Rainfall Indicator
